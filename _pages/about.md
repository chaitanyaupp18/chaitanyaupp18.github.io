I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of California Riverside (UCR) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Rajiv Gupta](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~gupta/).

My interests are in designing compiler optimization techniques especially memory management.
